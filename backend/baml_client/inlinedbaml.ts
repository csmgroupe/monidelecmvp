Your task is to analyze floor plans with 100% accuracy and room coverage.\n\n    Core Analysis Process:\n    1. SCAN PHASE\n       - Systematically scan each floor plan from top-left to bottom-right\n       - Mark each distinct enclosed space\n       - Note all doors, windows, and fixed fixtures\n       - Pay special attention to room corners and alcoves\n    \n    2. MEASUREMENT PHASE\n       - Calculate surface area of each space in square meters\n       - Include any recesses or alcoves in the measurements\n       - For irregular shapes, break down into regular geometric shapes\n       - Double-check all measurements\n    \n    3. CLASSIFICATION PHASE\n       - Classify each space according to these rules:\n         * Kitchen: Look for cooking fixtures, counters\n         * LivingRoom: Largest open space without bed/kitchen fixtures\n         * LivingRoomWithIntegratedKitchen: Open space with visible kitchen fixtures\n         * CirculationArea: Hallways/landings > 4m², utility rooms, storage spaces\n         * WetRoom: Bathroom fixtures without WC\n         * WC: Toilet fixture only\n         * BathroomWithWC: Both bathroom and toilet fixtures\n         * Bedroom: Spaces suitable for beds, typically with windows\n         * Other: Closets, small halls < 4m², garage\n         * ExteriorSpace: Terraces, balconies, patios, covered terraces, porches\n\n    4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n       - Confirm every visible space is classified\n       - Verify room connections are logical\n       - Check total area matches approximate building footprint\n       - Ensure no spaces are counted twice\n       - Verify each room has appropriate access (doors)\n\n    Special Instructions:\n    - For studio apartments:\n      * Main space MUST be LivingRoomWithIntegratedKitchen\n      * Do not classify any space as Bedroom\n      * Typically includes: main space, bathroom/WC, possibly circulation\n    \n    - For multiple floor plans:\n      * Analyze each plan separately first\n      * Combine all rooms into final list\n      * Maintain consistent naming across plans\n    \n    Common Error Prevention:\n    - Small spaces between rooms are usually circulation areas\n    - Check for hidden alcoves in irregular walls\n    - Verify that room classification matches typical French residential conventions\n    - If uncertain about a space, mark it as Other with a note\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n\n    {{ _.role(\"user\") }} {{ floorplans }}\n  \"#\n}\n\ntest SingleFloorPlanTest {\n  functions [AnalyzeMultipleFloorPlans]\n  args {\n    floorplans [\n      {\n        file \"fixtures/plan-littoral.webp\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\ntest MultipleFloorPlansTest {\n  functions [AnalyzeMultipleFloorPlans]\n  args {\n    floorplans [\n      {\n        file \"fixtures/plan-littoral.webp\"\n      },\n      {\n        file \"fixtures/ecrin-bleu.webp\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\ntest StudioFloorPlanTest {\n  functions [AnalyzeMultipleFloorPlans]\n  args {\n    floorplans [\n      {\n        file \"fixtures/studio.jpg\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\ntest PlanLatest {\n  functions [AnalyzeMultipleFloorPlans]\n  args {\n    floorplans [\n      {\n        file \"fixtures/plan-latest.png\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}",
